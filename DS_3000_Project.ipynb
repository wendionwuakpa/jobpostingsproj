When infrastructure is missing or incomplete you surface the needs and work with infra teams to ensure that they are understood. You're innovative. You're a builder. You show people the value of your ideas by bringing them to life in tangible, innovative ways.

      "Through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), the Geo-Analysis & Monitoring Team within NETL's Research & Innovation Center's Geological & Environmental Systems directorate is looking for a motivated student interested in performing research focusing on geological and environmental sciences to evaluate environmental impacts and risk assessments associated with domestic energy resource development. The student will learn about and take part in a research project involving the combination of conventional geologic methods with data science and machine learning. The applicant should have coursework and a solid background in geology and be prepared to learn more about integration of data science methods into geoscience, and collaborate with experts on the Team in support of project goals that focus on improving data search and characterization using machine learning algorithms for subsurface, geologic systems associated with onshore and offshore sedimentary basins aligned with oil, natural gas, and carbon storage systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a NETL intern, you will support the Geo-Analysis & Monitoring Team to identify, format and characterize key datasets using a combination of conventional and data science driven methods. These datasets are the foundation to conducting advanced research that integrates and quantitatively evaluates key attributes of shale gas, ultra-deep water and frontier regions to estimate potential risks related to oil/natural gas development, rare earth elements characterization, and/or carbon storage. Another goal of this research project is development and adaptation of data science and machine learning methods that focus on improving data search and characterization.\n",
